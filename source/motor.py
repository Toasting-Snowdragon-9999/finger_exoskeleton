"""
Drives the tendon motor from the live EMG.

Emil's ProportionalEMGController (source/controllers.py) moves the finger
between open and closed in proportion to a grasp signal (0 = open, 1 = closed).
It runs its own loop at MOTOR_RATE_HZ in a separate thread (MotorThread), so a
slow serial bus can never hold up the EMG. GraspSignal decides what it sees:

  DISARMED     -> 0, the finger opens (not calibrated yet, or recalibrating)
  no fresh EMG -> None (newest block older than STALE_S); the controller holds the
                  last value for SIGNAL_TIMEOUT_S, then opens
  IDLE         -> 0, the finger opens, so rest activity does not move it
  GRASP_ARMED  -> the grasp activation: the finger follows the grip
  STIFFENED    -> the mean grasp of the last HOLD_WINDOW_S before the tremor was
                  detected: the finger holds its position instead of following the tremor

The motor runs in extended position mode (4), so open and closed may lie on
both sides of the 0/4095 wrap. Only motor MOTOR_ID is touched.
